# Monster Hunter World - Hunter's Notes

An app that fetches data of monsters from the MHW API and presents it as three different categories. Overhaul of [previous version](https://github.com/KhaledAjaj2026/mhw-notebook/).

## Motivation

Wanted to gain experience in revamping/redesigning older projects, as this is a common responsibility in developing websites. Learn to use Figma to design websites instead of frontend mockups. Practice presenting data in a legible and interactive manner to users.

## Lessons Learned

Enjoyed making website designs using Figma, made process of figuring out UI/UX much easier. Separating logic into components made debugging an easy feat as issues could be narrowed down to distinct functions. Created dynamically-loaded UI components, with functions rendering JSX according to data fetched from API. 

Learned to use third-party libraries to my advantage, as they save time and effort better used for developing components. MUI-Autocomplete and Alice-Carousel were particularly helpful in achieving the desired functionality for the website. Learned to reference documentation for understanding how third-party libraries can be implemented into my project.

## Possible Future Updates

* Include small monsters in search queries and autocomplete.
* Help update API source code, as some data is missing about some monsters (e.g. 'rewards' show up empty).
